; POLYGONS -- navigation around polygons via the shortest path
;*******************************************************************************

; Given a starting and ending position on a 2-dimensional plane, and 
; polygons that serve as obstacles, find the shortest path from start to end
; that doesn't cross a polygon.  The path is allowed to run along a side of
; a polygon.  It hasn't been stated whether the path is allowed to squeeze
; through if two polygons touch.  I'm assuming that this is allowed.

; Only straight line segments need be considered as parts of the path --
; in free space (i.e. when crossing an area without obstacles) a straight
; line is shortest.  And the obstacles all have straight sides, so a path
; that's hugging the side of an obstacle will still be composed of straight
; line segments.

; The only points that need be considered as stopping points along the path
; are the start and end points and vertices of the polygons -- no path that
; includes points other than these will be shorter.  (Note that this does not
; preclude having points that lie on some polygon's side other than at one
; of its vertices, because it is legal for a vertex of one polygon to touch
; a side of another.)

; Concave polygons, and polygonal perimeters, are supported.

; The main requirement for supporting concave polygons is that one must know
; which side is the inside of the polygon.  For this reason, I'm requiring
; the user to list the vertices in counterclockwise order.

; A perimeter is a border, outside of which the path may not go.
; To distinguish between an enclosing polygon and an enclosed polygon, the
; order of the vertex list is reversed.  That is, the vertices are listed
; in counterclockwise with respect to the "center" of the polygon.  For
; an enclosing polygon, the "center" would be at infinity, and the order
; would be counterclockwise when viewed from the enclosed region exterior
; to that polygon.  (We may get this extension for free if support for
; concave polygons were added.)

; I'm not trying to support overlapping polygons.

; Before we go any further, try to make sure we don't get bit by roundoff error,
; by telling LISP to regard all non-integers as long-floats.  Apparently
; long-float is required to be the largest number of bits, and may be larger
; than double-float.  But some LISPs may not have long-floats.  Clisp seems
; to have it, and it *is* bigger than clisp's double float.

; REPRESENTATION OF THE WORLD
;*******************************************************************************

; The world is represented by a list of (non-overlapping) polygons,
; plus the start and goal points.  All of these are globals.

(declaim (special *polygons* *start* *goal*))

; Each polygon is represented as a list of vertices.  The vertices must be
; listed in order of a counterclockwise traversal around the edges of the
; polygon, with the first two vertices repeated at the end of the list.
; That way, each vertex of the polygon appears in this list surrounded by
; its two adjacent vertices.  When we use the list, we start at the second
; vertex, and quit at the second to last.  (See the routine on-polygon,
; below, which makes use of this convenience.)  It is not necessary to make
; the user supply their raw polygons this way -- we can tack on the duplicate
; vertices ourselves.  (For now, because time is short, I'll provide the
; vertex lists with the repeats.)

; A vertex is represented as a list of two numbers, of which the first is
; the x coordinate and the second the y coordinate.

;*******************************************************************************
; REPRESENTATION OF A STATE
;*******************************************************************************

; A state is a single point, which is one of: the start point, the goal
; point, or a vertex of a polygon.  The state is represented as a list of two
; numbers, x coordinate first, then y coordinate.  It is not necessary to
; include the world in each state, because the world is static.

; It is not necessary to keep a separate list of legal state points, apart from
; the world information, but it may be convenient to do so.

;*******************************************************************************
; Distinguishing legal successor states
;*******************************************************************************

; How do we know what points are legal successors of the current point?
; (I'll refer to a potential successor point as the candidate point, and
; the line segment from the current point to the candidate point as the
; candidate path.)

; There are two types of test that may need to be made.

; Test 1:

; The first is needed only if the current point is on a polygon (which will
; be true except perhaps for the starting point) and if the candidate point
; is also on that polygon.  Such a path may not be excluded by a check for
; intersection with polygon sides, because the candidate path will run
; unobstructed through the interior of the polygon.

; For a convex polygon, the only legal successors *on the same polygon* are
; points on the sides adjacent to the current point.  (That's assuming one
; protects against the degenerate case of colinear adjacent sides -- then
; more than just the immediately adjacent side might be legal.  Not a real
; problem, since we could remove the unneeded vertices at the outset.)  So
; we'd need to check if the candidate point were on a non-adjacent side or
; vertex, and exclude those.  Checking for that is O(n) in the number of
; vertices of the polygon.  And besides, it doesn't work for concave polygons.

; An alternative that's O(1) is to check the direction of the candidate path
; vs. the directions of the adjacent sides -- we don't care if the candidate
; point is on the same polygon or not:  If the candidate path goes into the
; interior of the polygon, we don't want it.  This test will exclude some
; successors that would also be excluded by intersection tests, but then, if
; we exclude 'em here, we don't have to do that test...

; A picture really is worth a thousand words here...even an ASCII picture.
; This shows a *concave* polygon, with a legal candidate path, i.e. one that
; lies in the exterior of the polygon.

;   candidate point               /
;                   \            /side 1 of polygon
;      candidate path\          /
;                     \        /
;                      \      /
; exterior of polygon   \    /
;                        \  /
;          _______________\/current point
;    side 2 of polygon
;
;                       interior of polygon

; If we start from side 1 (which is the side clockwise from the current point
; in the vertex list of the polygon), and sweep around counterclockwise, then
; if we encounter the candidate path before we encounter side 2 of the polygon,
; the candidate path is in the exterior of the polygon (at least to begin with,
; and for convex polygons, a path that starts in the exterior, stays in the
; exterior).

; If the current point is in the middle of some polygon side rather than at a
; vertex, the only difference is that the side 1 and side 2 segments are from
; the current point to the endpoints of that one side, not the endpoints of
; the two sides adjacent to the current point.

; Gory details of this check are with the routines below.

; Test 2:

; If a candidate path survives that test, we still need to see if it runs
; through some *other* polygon besides the one the current point is on.

; We want to allow path segments that *end up* on a polygon side -- after all,
; that's going to be all of them except possibly the one that goes to the goal.
; *However*, we do not want to allow a path that sneaks through a vertex into
; the interior of some polygon.  One might then exclude paths that don't end
; up at a vertex, but rather continue on beyond it.  Except...it's legal for
; the path to go through and beyond a vertex as long as what's beyond is not
; inside the polygon.  Fortunately, this doesn't matter:  If we exclude a path
; segment that passes through and goes beyond a vertex, then we know that that
; very vertex will also be a candidate successor, and we *can* form a path
; segment that goes to that vertex and stops.  From there, another step in the
; search can extend the path on to whatever the original segment's destination
; was.  The path length will be identical, and that's all we care about -- we
; don't care at all that it took two steps instead of one.

; So the intersection test is:  Disallow a path if it *crosses through* some
; polygon side anywhere on that side, including vertices.  Permit the path
; if it doesn't touch a polygon side, or if it runs along that side, or if its
; endpoint is on that side.

; In summary, the tests are:

; 1: If the current point is on a polygon (or polygons), check if the candidate
; path is interior to that/those polygon(s).  Exclude it if so.

; 2: Then check if the candidate path passes through any polygon sides.  Exclude
; it if so.

; SUCCESSORS function
;*******************************************************************************

; This is the hard part.  Break it up into tiny pieces.

;*******************************************************************************
; Test 1 -- see if path is inside a polygon (see "legal successor states" above)
;*******************************************************************************

; This helper function that checks if a given point (which will be the current
; state) is on a polygon (either a vertex or a side), and if so, returns a list
; containing (at the front) the endpoint of the polygon side to clockwise of
; the point, the point itself, and the endpoint of the polygon side to
; counterclockwise of the point.  For convex polygons, a point can only be on
; one vertex or side, so we can stop when we get to the first match.

; If the point is a vertex, then we can just return a tail of the polygon list
; that starts with the vertex prior to the matching vertex -- we won't touch
; anything but the first three items in the list, so we don't care what's
; beyond.

; If the point is somewhere in the middle of a side, then we'll need to make
; a fresh list.

; It makes use of a function "in-segment", which takes a point, and endpoints
; of a line segment, and figures out if the point is in that segment, excluding
; the endpoints.  Because this is related to the intersection code, it has been
; put in that file.

(defun on-polygon (point polygon)
   ; We enter with a polygon list, or the tail of one.  See if the point is
   ; equal to the vertex that's *second* in the (partial) polygon list.  If not,

   ; point, the second is a duplicate, and we've already checked that one.
   ; E.g. say the polygon list contains points (a b c d e a b).  We start by
   ; checking b, then c, d, e, a, and quit there.  At all times, we have

; The next helper function is rather clumsy -- it's the thing that sees if the
; candidate path is in the "interior" or "exterior" of the angle defined by
; the triple produced above.  We have three line segments:
;
;   side1, which extends from the current point to the clockwise vertex
;   side2, which extends from the current point to the counterclockwise vertex
;   path, which extends from the current point to the candidate point

; Attempt to avoid calculations by doing this:
;
;   Translate the points to make the current point the origin (i.e. just
;     subtract the current point from the others), getting just a list of
;     endpoints of the translated segments.
;
;   Find out what quadrants they're all in.  (Let the positive x axis be part
;     of quadrant 1, etc.)
;
;   Find out if side1 is closer, in the counterclockwise direction, to path
;     or to side2.  This is easy if path and side2 are in different quadrants,
;     so do that check first.  Then, if they are in the same quadrant, there
;     are two cases:  If side1 is also in that quadrant, compare the slopes
;     of all three: path is ok if we have side1, path, side2 in clockwise order.
;     If side1 is not in that quadrant, compare the slopes of path and side2:
;     path is ok if its slope is clockwise from side2's.

; It's no better to calculate angles (which would mean taking the arctan of the
; quotient of the coordinates, and which would likely be subject to roundoff
; error), because we'd still have to check which quadrant the points were
; in, to tell how to interpret the sign of the result, and to avoid infinities
; for vertical lines.

; But first, a helper for the helper -- a function that subtracts two points
; by subtracting their x coords and y coords separately.  That is, this finds
; the (vector) offset from point2 to point1.  Or, it translates point1 by
; making point2 the new origin.

(defun offset (point1 point2)

; And another helper -- this one decides what quadrant a point is in.  Recall
; I'm putting each axis with the quadrant that's counterclockwise from it.
; We won't pass (0 0) to this, because we won't be making any null moves, so
; the candidate will never be the current point, nor will we allow polygons
; with zero-length sides.

;*******************************************************************************

;*******************************************************************************

; Both of these just compute the length of a line segment.  The cost function
; takes two args -- current and successor points.  The heuristic function takes
; one arg, a candidate point, and calculates the distance to the goal.  So just
; make a "length" function, which will be the cost function.  For the goal
; function, make a closure of the length function with one point being the goal
; point.  There is a function that computes length in intersect.lsp, called
; "dist" but not in a form I can use directly -- it doesn't take "points" but
; rather a flat list of four coordinates: x and y for the first point, then
; x and y for the second.  Use it, and convert the args.
